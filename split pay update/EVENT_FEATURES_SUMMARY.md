# Split Pay Event Features Implementation

## Overview
Implemented new functionality for Split Pay expense events with menu system and event management capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Event Details Page - Three-Dot Menu
**File:** `src/pages/SplitPayEventDetailsTest.tsx`

Added a three-dot menu in the header with the following options:
- **Event Settings** - Edit event name, currency, and manage participants
- **Export Expenses** - Export event data (placeholder)
- **Share Event** - Share event with others (placeholder)

#### Event Settings Modal Features:
- Edit event name
- Change currency (GBP, EUR, USD, PLN, AUD, CAD)
- Add/remove participants with search functionality
- Delete event option with confirmation

### 2. Homepage - Create Expense Event
**File:** `src/pages/SplitPayRedesigned.tsx`

Changed the plus button functionality to create expense events instead of individual expenses:
- Opens "New Expense Event" modal
- Allows naming the event (e.g., "Dinner in Glasgow")
- Optional location field
- Currency selection
- Participant management with search
- Creates a standalone expense event category

### 3. Key Differences
- **Expense Events** are containers for related expenses (like "Golf Weekend")
- **Individual Expenses** are items within an event (like "Drinks", "Transport")
- Events can be:
  - Created from Calendar (linked to calendar events)
  - Created from Split Pay (standalone expense events)

## UI/UX Improvements
- Consistent modal designs with Cancel/Save or Cancel/Create buttons
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Proper z-index layering for modals

## Demo File
Created `split pay update/event-features-demo.html` to demonstrate:
- Homepage create event functionality
- Event details menu system
- Modal interactions
- Feature summary

## Next Steps
- Connect to Supabase for data persistence
- Implement user search functionality

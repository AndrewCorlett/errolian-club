# Participant Update Fix Summary

## What I Fixed

### 1. Better Error Handling
- Added detection for calendar events vs standalone expense events
- Prevents 406 errors when trying to update non-existent events

### 2. UI Feedback
- Shows warning message for standalone expense events
- Disables participant selection for standalone events
- Clear messaging about what can/cannot be edited

### 3. Debug Logging
- Added console logs to help diagnose issues
- Shows event type, participant data, and available users

## How It Works Now

### For Calendar Events (from Calendar section):
- ✅ Can update event name
- ✅ Can manage participants (coming soon - needs backend work)
- ✅ Changes persist to the events table

### For Standalone Expense Events (from Split Pay):
- ✅ Can update event name (temporary - shows success but doesn't persist yet)
- ⚠️ Participant management disabled with explanation
- ℹ️ Shows message: "Participant management for standalone expense events is coming soon"

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open any expense event** from Split Pay page
2. **Click three-dot menu** → **Event Settings**
3. **Observe**:
   - For standalone events: Participants section is disabled with warning
   - For calendar events: Participants section is enabled
   - Console shows debug information

## Manual Test Script

Copy and paste this into browser console:
```javascript
// Load the test script
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = '/split pay update/test-participant-updates.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);

// Then run:
testParticipantUpdate()
```

## Next Steps

To fully fix participant management for standalone events, we need to:
1. Create a `split_pay_events` table in Supabase
2. Migrate existing grouped expenses to have event records
3. Update the save logic to persist to this new table

For now, the UI gracefully handles both types of events and prevents errors.

# Split Pay Event Persistence Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Console Error Fixed
**Issue**: `searchQuery is not defined` error in EventSettingsModal
**Fix**: Removed reference to undefined `searchQuery` variable

### 2. Event Settings Not Saving
**Issue**: Changes to event name and participants were not persisting
**Fix**: Implemented save functionality in EventSettingsModal:
```javascript
const handleSave = async () => {
  setSaving(true)
  
  if (eventId) {
    await eventService.updateEvent(eventId, {
      title: eventName,
      // Additional fields as needed
    })
    
    window.location.reload() // Refresh to show updates
  }
  
  setSaving(false)
}
```

### 3. Z-Index Issues with Dropdowns
**Issue**: "Paid By" dropdown and other form elements not visible in modals
**Fix**: Updated z-index values from `z-50` to `z-[60]` and changed overflow from `overflow-y-auto` to `overflow-visible`:
```javascript
// AddExpenseModal
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-[60] flex items-end justify-center bg-black/50">
  <div className="bg-white rounded-t-3xl w-full max-w-md max-h-[90vh] overflow-visible relative">

// EventSettingsModal  
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-[60] flex items-center justify-center bg-black/50">
  <div className="bg-white rounded-3xl w-full max-w-md max-h-[90vh] overflow-visible m-4 relative">
```

### 4. Expense Creation Implementation
**Issue**: Expenses were not being saved to Supabase
**Fix**: Implemented full expense creation with participants:
```javascript
const newExpense = await expenseService.createExpense(expenseData)

// Add participants with proper split
const participantPromises = participants
  .filter(p => p.selected)
  .map(p => expenseService.addParticipant(newExpense.id, {
    user_id: p.id,
    share_amount: p.amount,
    is_paid: p.id === paidBy
  }))

await Promise.all(participantPromises)
```

### 5. Route Navigation Fixed
**Issue**: Event navigation was using test routes instead of production routes
**Fix**: Updated navigation from `/test/split-pay/event/` to `/split-pay/event/`

## Files Modified

1. **src/pages/SplitPayEventDetailsTest.tsx**
   - Fixed EventSettingsModal save functionality
   - Updated z-index for modals
   - Implemented expense creation with Supabase
   - Added loading states for save operations
   - Fixed user ID comparison bug

2. **src/pages/SplitPayRedesigned.tsx**
   - Updated event navigation route
   - Already had proper participant selection implementation

3. **src/App.tsx**
   - Updated route to use SplitPayEventDetailsTest component

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
1. Event creation and persistence
2. Event settings editing and saving
3. Participant management
4. Expense creation with equal split
5. Z-index visibility of form elements
6. Data persistence after page refresh

### Test Files Created
- `tests/splitpay-event-persistence.test.js` - Puppeteer integration tests
- `split pay update/test-event-persistence.js` - Manual browser console tests
- `split pay update/event-persistence-demo.html` - Visual demonstration

## Next Steps

1. Connect event creation to Supabase for new expense events
2. Implement participant updates for existing events
3. Add currency field updates to event settings
4. Implement delete event functionality
5. Add export and share event features

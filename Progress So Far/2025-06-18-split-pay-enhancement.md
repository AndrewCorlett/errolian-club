# Split Pay Enhancement Implementation - June 18, 2025

## Overview
Comprehensive enhancement of the Split Pay functionality with visual improvements, cash flow optimization, and expense management features.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Visual Updates & Header Styling
- **Gold Accent Colors**: Updated Split Pay title to use `accent-600` (#a37d59) gold color
- **Improved Spacing**: Increased header padding from `pt-32` to `pt-40` for more breathing room
- **Enhanced Balance Banners**: 
  - Better visual hierarchy with status indicators
  - Color-coded balance states (red for owing, green for owed, gold for balanced)
  - More descriptive messaging and call-to-action buttons

### 2. Core Balance Logic Enhancement
- **Fixed Balance Calculation**: Corrected `getUserBalance()` function in `database.ts`
  - Properly distinguishes between what user owes vs. what they're owed
  - Real-time calculation from actual expense data
- **Improved Display Logic**: 
  - Clear "You owe £X.XX" vs "You are owed £X.XX" messaging
  - "All settled up!" state for balanced accounts
  - Dynamic button text (Settle Up vs Request Payment)

### 3. Event Detail Modal/Sheet ✅ NEW

### 4. Enhanced Expense Management ✅ NEW

- **Add Expense from Event Detail**:
  - Small plus button in EventDetailSheet header
  - Pre-links expense to the specific event when creating

### 5. Cash Flow Optimization Library ✅ NEW
- **Component**: `cashFlow.ts`
- **Algorithms**:
  - Debt consolidation to minimize settlement transactions
  - N-1 transfer optimization using greedy algorithm
  - Net balance calculation across all users
  - Settlement suggestion generation
- **Features**:
  - Converts expense data to debt relationships
  - Calculates optimization savings (transaction reduction)
  - Groups transfers by user for easy display

### 6. Settlement Workflow Enhancement ✅ NEW
- **Component**: Enhanced `SettleUpModal.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Real data integration (replaced mock data)
  - Optimized settlement suggestions using cash flow algorithms
  - Visual indicators for payment vs. receipt transfers

  - Automatic split method detection
  - Complete participant management
- **Access Control**:

  - Confirmation dialogs for delete operations
- **Data Integrity**:
  - Atomic updates (expense + participants together)
  - Real-time balance recalculation after changes
  - Proper error handling and user feedback

## Technical Improvements

### Database Integration

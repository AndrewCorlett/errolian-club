**Session Duration**: ~90 minutes  
**Focus**: Major functionality fixes, GBP currency implementation, and UI polish

## 📋 Session Overview
This session addressed critical functionality issues in split-pay and calendar systems, implemented comprehensive GBP currency formatting, enhanced UI layouts, and added dynamic user rank display. The session focused on fixing core user-facing problems while improving the overall polish of the application.

## ✅ **COMPLETED TASKS - 8/12 TOTAL**

### **HIGH PRIORITY COMPLETIONS**

#### **1. Split Pay Expense Creation - PARTIAL FIX (REQUIRES FOLLOW-UP)**
**Status**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**
- ✅ Updated database service to handle participants properly
- ✅ Changed default currency from AUD to GBP in database
- ✅ Enhanced createExpense function with transaction support
- ❌ **STILL FAILING** - Console error shows: `"Could not find the 'participants' column of 'expenses' in the schema cache"`

**Error Analysis:**
```
POST https://ijsvrotcvrvrmnzazxya.supabase.co/rest/v1/expenses?select=* 400 (Bad Request)
Failed to create expense: {code: 'PGRST204', details: null, hint: null, message: "Could not find the 'participants' column of 'expenses' in the schema cache"}
```

**Proposed Solution:**
The issue is that the frontend is still trying to send `participants` as part of the expenses table insert. The fix requires:
1. Update the `handleExpenseCreate` function in SplitPay.tsx to NOT pass participants to the expense service
2. Modify the createExpense service to accept participants separately and handle the two-table transaction properly
3. Ensure the expense creation happens first, then participants are added using the expense ID

#### **2. GBP Currency Implementation (COMPLETED)**
**Objective**: Replace all AUD references with GBP formatting
- ✅ Updated database default currency to 'GBP'
- ✅ Updated AddExpenseModal to use GBP currency and £ symbols
- ✅ Updated SplitPay page displays to show £ instead of $
- ✅ Updated Home dashboard financial overview to use £ symbols
- ✅ All amount displays now properly show British Pound formatting

#### **3. Calendar Day Headers Fix (COMPLETED)**
**Objective**: Fix weekday headers to remain visible when scrolling
- ✅ Updated VerticalCalendar sticky positioning to `top-[80px]`
- ✅ Enhanced header styling with backdrop blur and primary color scheme
- ✅ Fixed month title positioning to `top-[130px]` below day headers
- ✅ Day headers now stay fixed below main navigation during scroll

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY COMPLETIONS**

#### **4. Header Compaction (COMPLETED)**
**Objective**: Reduce excessive whitespace in calendar and overall headers
- ✅ Reduced IOSHeader padding from `pt-3 pb-2` to `pt-2 pb-1`
- ✅ Decreased navigation row height from `min-h-[44px]` to `min-h-[40px]`
- ✅ Reduced title font size from `text-2xl` to `text-xl`
- ✅ Updated Calendar page top padding from `pt-28` to `pt-20`
- ✅ Adjusted all sticky positioning calculations accordingly

#### **5. Dynamic Rank Display (COMPLETED)**
**Objective**: Replace static "Welcome to your club!" with user rank
- ✅ Created `getRankTitle()` function mapping database roles to display titles
- ✅ Role mapping: `super-admin`/`commodore` → "Commodore", `officer` → "Officer", `member` → "Member"
- ✅ Updated IOSHeader subtitle to show `${getRankTitle()} • Errolian Club`
- ✅ Dynamic display now reflects user's actual role from profile table

### **LOW PRIORITY COMPLETIONS**

#### **6. Dashboard Enhancements (COMPLETED)**
- ✅ **Logo Enlargement**: Changed from `size="sm"` to `size="lg"` in dashboard header
- ✅ **Widget Spacing**: Increased top padding from `pt-32` to `pt-36` for better layout
- ✅ **Clean Interface**: Removed notifications button, leaving only profile button in header

## 🚨 **CRITICAL NEXT JOB - EXPENSE CREATION FIX**

### **Immediate Priority: Fix Split Pay Expense Creation**
**Problem**: Supabase receiving malformed request with `participants` column that doesn't exist
**Root Cause**: Frontend sending participants as part of expense object instead of handling separately

**My Proposed Solution:**
1. **Update SplitPay.tsx `handleExpenseCreate` function:**
   ```typescript
   const handleExpenseCreate = async (expenseData: any) => {
     try {
       // Extract participants before sending to service
       const { participants, ...expenseOnly } = expenseData
       
       const newExpense = await expenseService.createExpense({
         ...expenseOnly,
         paid_by: user.id
       })
       
       // Then add participants separately
       if (participants && participants.length > 0) {
         await Promise.all(
           participants.map(p => 
             expenseService.addParticipant(newExpense.id, p.user_id, p.share_amount)
           )
         )
       }
       
       // Reload and show success
       const expensesResponse = await expenseService.getExpenses(1, 100)
       setExpenses(expensesResponse.data)
       setShowAddExpenseModal(false)
     } catch (err) {
       console.error('Failed to create expense:', err)
       alert('Failed to create expense. Please try again.')
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Revert createExpense service to original simple version** - the complex transaction logic should be handled at the page level, not service level

3. **Test expense creation thoroughly** with different participant configurations

## 🔄 **REMAINING TASKS - 4/12**

### **High Priority**
- ❌ **Create desktop breakpoint with fixed sidebar instead of bottom navigation**
  - Implement responsive design for desktop users
  - Replace mobile bottom nav with left sidebar on larger screens
  - Ensure all functionality accessible in both layouts

### **Medium Priority**
- ❌ **Apply proper regal theme to mark availability card and all buttons**
  - Update AvailabilitySheet component with new color scheme
  - Ensure button theming consistency across all components

  - Enhance availability marking to support date ranges
  - Allow users to mark extended periods as available/unavailable

### **Low Priority**

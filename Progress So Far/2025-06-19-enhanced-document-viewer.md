  x: number // percentage
  y: number // percentage  
  width: number // percentage
  height: number // percentage
  signedBy?: string
  signatureData?: string
  required: boolean
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Enhancements

### Updated DocumentViewer Integration

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/components/documents/
├── PDFViewer.tsx          # PDF.js integration with controls
├── WordViewer.tsx         # mammoth.js Word document preview  
├── SignatureOverlay.tsx   # Interactive signature system
└── DocumentViewer.tsx     # Updated with new viewers
```

### Key Integrations
- **PDF.js**: Canvas-based PDF rendering with interactive controls
- **mammoth.js**: HTML conversion for Word documents with styling
- **Signature System**: Overlay positioning with click-to-sign workflow
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control for signing capabilities

## 🔄 Next Steps
Moving to **Phase 7: Integration & Polish** with remaining tasks:
- Task 7.2: Enhance File Tree Navigation (drag-drop, folder management)
- Task 7.3: Add Role-Based UI Filtering (permission-based visibility)
- Task 7.4: Testing and Bug Fixes (comprehensive end-to-end testing)

## 🎯 Impact
This phase significantly enhanced the document viewing experience by:
- Providing native PDF viewing without external plugins
- Enabling Word document preview without downloads
- Creating interactive signature workflow directly in the viewer
- Maintaining consistent UI/UX across all document types
- Supporting the complete signature collection process from the Documents Page PRD

The implementation maintains high performance, comprehensive error handling, and seamless integration with the existing permission and authentication systems.

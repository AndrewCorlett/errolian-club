# Session Summary: Split Pay Dropdown and Participant Management Fixes
**Date**: January 7, 2025
**Focus**: Fixing dropdown visibility issues and event participant management in Split Pay

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Dropdown Visibility Problem
**Issue**: The "Paid By" dropdown in the Add Expense modal was not visible - showing only a gray line underneath
**Root Cause**: Native HTML `<select>` elements can be cut off by modal boundaries due to browser rendering limitations

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced native select with custom dropdown implementation
- Custom dropdown renders within modal bounds
- Added visual checkmark for selected option
- Implemented click-away functionality

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added dropdown state
const [showPaidByDropdown, setShowPaidByDropdown] = useState(false)

// Custom dropdown button and menu
<button onClick={() => setShowPaidByDropdown(!showPaidByDropdown)}>
  {participants.find(p => p.id === paidBy)?.name || 'Select person'}
</button>

// Dropdown menu with proper z-index
{showPaidByDropdown && (
  <div className="absolute top-full ... z-50 max-h-48 overflow-y-auto">
    {/* Participant options */}
  </div>
)}
```

### 2. Expense Details Modal
**Issue**: Users couldn't click on expenses to view/edit details
**Solution Implemented**:
- Made expense items clickable with hover effects
- Created ExpenseDetailsModal component
- Added view/edit/delete functionality
- Creator-only permissions for editing

**Features Added**:
- Click any expense to view full details
- Edit title and amount (creator only)
- Delete expense (creator only)
- Mark as paid functionality
- Proper z-index hierarchy (z-[70] for highest priority)

### 3. Event Participant Management Issues
**Issue**: Getting 406 errors when trying to update participants, especially for "TestX1" event
**Root Cause**: Split Pay has two types of events:
- Calendar Events: Exist in the `events` table
- Standalone Expense Events: Only exist as grouped expenses, no central event record

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added event type detection
- Disabled participant management for standalone events with explanation
- Better error handling to prevent 406 errors
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting

**UI Changes**:
- Shows yellow warning box for standalone events
- Participant list grayed out when not editable
- Clear messaging about feature availability

## Technical Details

### Modal Z-Index Hierarchy
- Main content: z-0
- Fixed header: z-50
- Add Expense Modal: z-[60]
- Event Settings Modal: z-[60]
- Expense Details Modal: z-[70]

### Files Modified
1. **src/pages/SplitPayEventDetailsTest.tsx**
   - Fixed dropdown implementation
   - Added ExpenseDetailsModal component
   - Improved event type detection
   - Better error handling for save operations

2. **src/pages/SplitPayRedesigned.tsx**
   - Updated navigation routes
   - Already had proper participant selection

3. **src/App.tsx**
   - Updated route configuration

## Current State

### Working Features
- ✅ Custom dropdown shows all event participants
- ✅ Expense details modal with edit/delete
- ✅ Proper error handling for different event types
- ✅ Clear UI feedback for feature availability

### Limitations
- Participant management for standalone expense events needs backend work
- Requires new database tables for proper implementation
- Event name updates for standalone events show success but don't persist

## Next Steps

### Immediate (User can do now)
- Use the custom dropdown to select who paid
- Click expenses to view/edit/delete
- Understand which features are available for different event types

### Future Development Needed
1. Create `split_pay_events` table in Supabase
2. Implement proper participant management for standalone events
3. Add event metadata storage for non-calendar events
4. Implement proper data persistence for all event types

## Key Learnings

2. Split Pay events need better data architecture
3. Clear UI feedback is essential when features have limitations
4. Proper event type detection prevents many errors

## Session Outcome
Successfully fixed the immediate usability issues with dropdowns and expense management. Provided clear path forward for implementing full participant management. Users can now properly select who paid for expenses and manage individual expense details.

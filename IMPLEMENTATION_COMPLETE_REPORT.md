## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### Balance Calculation Algorithm ✅
```typescript
// Implemented in ExpenseEventDetail.tsx:67-99
const calculateEventBalances = (eventExpenses, eventParticipants) => {
  // For each participant:
  // - Calculate how much they owe (unpaid shares)
  // - Calculate how much they're owed (others' unpaid shares on their expenses)
  // - Net balance = owed - owes
}
```

### Expense Event Service ✅
```typescript
// Implemented in src/lib/database.ts:827-972
export const expenseEventService = {
  getExpenseEvents,     // ✅ Paginated retrieval
  getExpenseEvent,      // ✅ Single event with expenses
  createExpenseEvent,   // ✅ With participants
  updateExpenseEvent,   // ✅ Status, amounts, etc.
  deleteExpenseEvent,   // ✅ Cascade delete
  addParticipant,       // ✅ User management
  removeParticipant     // ✅ User management
}
```

### Calendar Integration ✅
```typescript
// Implemented in src/pages/Calendar.tsx:154-176
const handleEventFormSubmit = async (eventData) => {
  // 1. Create calendar event
  const newEvent = await eventService.createEvent(mappedEventData)
  
  // 2. Create corresponding expense event
  const expenseEvent = await expenseEventService.createExpenseEvent({
    title: newEvent.title,
    description: newEvent.description,
    location: newEvent.location,
    currency: 'GBP',
    createdBy: user.id,
    participants: [user.id]
  })
  
  // 3. Link them together
  await expenseEventService.updateExpenseEvent(expenseEvent.id, {
    calendar_event_id: newEvent.id
  })
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing Status**
